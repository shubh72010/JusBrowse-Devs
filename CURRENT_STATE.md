# Current State

## Summary of Completed Tasks
- Audited the entire site for unverified statistical claims and manufactured research metrics.
- Removed speculative or made-up statistics related to AdGuard/EasyPrivacy tracker reduction percentages.
- Replaced unverified data with objective, feature-focused descriptions of the **Surgical Interception Engine** and its use of `shouldInterceptRequest`.
- Updated both the **Technical Documentation** (Module 06) and the **Research Detail** view for Tracker Blocking to ensure strictly factual content.
- Ensured all technical claims are grounded in the actual browser implementation (header scrubbing, sub-resource interception, and persona-based isolation).

## Current Architecture
- `index.html`: Contains factual, implementation-centric documentation and research reports.
- `js/main.js`: Logic still correctly manages navigation and advanced search across the revised content.
- `css/styles.css`: Visual styling remains consistent and premium without relying on misleading metrics.

## Next Three Concrete Priorities
1. Perform a final sweep of the **Releases** and **FAQ** sections for any remaining unverified marketing claims.
2. Verify that the **Advanced Search** index has updated to reflect the new, factual content.
3. Conduct a final visual review to ensure the content changes haven't disrupted the layout or spacing.
